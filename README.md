# dcode://

A url scheme to share code.

# Setup

    git clone https://github.com/deckardai/dcode.git
    cd dcode
    make build-mac start-mac

This will install the url handler.

You should then be able to click links like this one and end up right in your text editor:

[dcode://dcode/tests/some_file?l=3&c=30](dcode://dcode/tests/some_file?l=3&c=30)
